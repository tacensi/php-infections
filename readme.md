Satan
=====

This repository is a compilation of malware, hacks, infections and other kind of trash found usually in PHP files on shared host environment. It's name comes from the first file of its kind that I found: `satan.php`.

None of the files found here are my creation. I made this compilation __for learning purposes only__.

## default-core

Files found on WP installation on Brazilian ISP Locaweb.

## search33
